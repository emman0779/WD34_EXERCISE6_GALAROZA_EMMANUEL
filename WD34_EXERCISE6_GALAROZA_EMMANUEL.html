                <p>Allen, officially the Municipality of Allen (Waray: Bungto han Allen; Tagalog: Bayan ng Allen), is a 5th class municipality in the province of Northern Samar, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 25,228 people.
                    It is located on the northwestern tip of the province, bordering the municipality of Victoria to the south, the municipality of Lavezares to the east, and the strategic San Bernardino Strait to both the north and west.
                    Allen is an important port for inter-island transport, specifically between the island of Samar and the island of Luzon.</p>
                <p>Before the Spanish colonisation of the Philippines, the original Malayan name of the town was Minapa-a. During the Spanish colonisation period, the name of the town was changed to La Granja. The name Allen was given by the Americans in honor of the American General Henry Tureman Allen,the military governor of the Visayas after the victory of the Americans over the Spaniards in the Spanish–American War. During the Japanese occupation, the town's name was changed to Tanaman, in accordance with Executive Order No. 110 signed in December 1942, to be "in line with the objective of the Greater East Asia War of eradicating all traces of Anglo-Saxon influence in East Asia."</p>

                <p>Allen is part of Northern Samar which is according to Australian studies, a part of the Philippines which is the homeland of the Polynesians. Otley Bayer said that there are already people in the Philippines 250,000 years ago and this was confirmed by a French study which says that the Philippines has been populated by men as early as 700,000 years ago. Some old Filipino historians still have the mindset of "Filipinos are savage and it has to be discovered and cultured by anything foreign". These historians refuses to mention that there is a civilization of Viking – like people based in the Lakanate of Lawan in Northern Samar (Samar was derived from Samaria). The Samar civilization was once headed by Datu Iberein as written by historian Henry Scott, and take note of the name, very Hebrew, consistent with Jewish Samar from Samaria. These people have siday (native epic) in which one of them is Bingi of Lawan, as mentioned by historian Alcina. They have Almuraya which is now an ancient ruins and they have royal burial jars—all evidences would point that this civilization could be the Ophir, the homeland of the Polynesians and Viking – like people who sent people to different parts of the Philippines and islands in the Pacific Ocean, including the people of Taiwan.The area of present-day Allen was originally populated by natives of Malay stock from the western and central portions of the island of Samar, particularly Catbalogan and Calbayog. Successive migrations to Allen from other islands that are near Allen were characterised by several waves. Malays from the neighbouring Bicol Peninsula in what is now Sorsogon crossed what is now the San Bernardino Strait using small sailing barges, trading with the locals before settling in, and inter-marrying with the local Malays many years after. Simultaneously, Malays of southern stock from Bohol through the islands of Capul and San Antonio crossed the strait and settled in the area.</p>
                <p>The heavy waves of migration from Bicol to Allen in Samar in the course of the centuries is attested by the fact that almost 70% of the peoples of Allen trace their ancestries to the families in Bicol, from the province of Sorsogon.</p>
                <p>The first recorded persons to have their names officially entered into a Spanish census in Allen were that of Cosmenia Cajandab and Mariano Cabacang; both surnames originated from the island of Capul.</p>
